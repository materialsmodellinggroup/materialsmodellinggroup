# Open positions

**Note: We currently have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. **

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!


### Applications for Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:abhiknc@iisc.ac.in). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.


### Master projects for IISc students
If you are a Master student at IISc looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [IISc admissions](https://iisc.ac.in/admissions/). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
