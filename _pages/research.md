# Research

### Computational Modelling

Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME)

Metal additive manufacturing

Study of pattern formation in self-organizing systems occurring during phase transformations such as solidification, electrochemical reactions and other transformations with elastic and magneto-elastic coupling.

Development of quantitative phase-field models for different phenomena.

Integration of different modelling techniques.


### Directional Solidification

Study of solidification in monotectic, eutectic systems and Ni based superalloys
